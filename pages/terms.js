            If you purchase products or services through the Mobile69 platform,
            you will be asked to provide billing information (e.g., name,
            billing address, credit card information) to the third-party payment
            processor designated by Mobile69 (“Payment Processor”). Mobile69 may

            warrant that all such billing information is complete and accurate,
            and that you are authorized to use such account information for such
            payments. The use of the Payment Processor is subject to any terms
            and conditions made available by the Payment Processor, and you must
            comply with all such terms and conditions. You acknowledge that you
            may be separately required to accept the Payment Processor’s own
            terms governing use of its services in the manner it specifies.

          <p>
            When you purchase or receive Virtual Currency products, you do not
            own them. Instead, you receive a limited right to use them for
            eligible services and merchandise on Mobile69 such as accessing
            locked content.
          </p>
          <p>
            We make no guarantee as to the nature, quality, or value of the
            services or merchandise that are connected with the use of Virtual
            Currency. The price for content will be displayed at the point of
            purchase. Using your Virtual Currency to access content grants you a
            limited license to access certain features on the Mobile69 platform
            when, as, and if allowed by us. All Virtual Currency transactions
            are final and we do not offer refunds for such transactions. We are
            not responsible for repairing or replacing content, or providing you
            with any credit or refund in the event that we modify, suspend, or
            terminate the Virtual Currency program, or for loss or damage due to
            any service error, or any other reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            Purchases of Virtual Currency may not be sub-licensed and are
            non-refundable and non-transferable, even if they expire or are
            revoked or discontinued. We may change the purchase price for
            Virtual Currency or for accessing content at any time, as well as
            the ways you can use Virtual Currency. We reserve the right to
            suspend, revoke, or stop issuing Virtual Currency or permitting
            their use at any time without notice, refund, or compensation, and
            to set expiration dates for Virtual Currency. Virtual Currency may
            not be redeemed for any sum of money or monetary value. If you
            delete your account or your account is terminated for any reason,
            you will lose all accumulated Virtual Currency without refund or
            other compensation. You agree that we will have no liability to you
            based on our exercise of our rights with respect to Virtual
            Currency.

            actual out-of-pocket economic loss. You agree that you will not ask
            for any consequential, special, punitive or exemplary damages, or
            indirect or lost profits. You agree that even if you request these
            types of damages, a court or arbitrator cannot award them to you.
            You understand and agree that the price of these Services would be
            significantly higher but for these limitations on liability. This
            limitation on liability shall not be construed to apply to any
            damages or other substantive remedies available via statute.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL CIRCUMSTANCES</strong>. You
            also agree that we are not responsible for anything beyond our
            control. For example, we are not liable: for Service interruptions
            caused by problems with the communications network; for problems
            caused by any Internet service provider; for your computer or its
            programs failing; for the acts of criminal attackers, whether in
            real-time or automated (e.g., viruses); other technologically
            harmful material that may infect your computer equipment, computer
            programs, data or proprietary material due to your use of the
            Websites or Mobile Apps or to your downloading of any content on it,
            or on any website linked to it; or for errors in information
            provided to us upon which we reasonably rely. These are only
            examples. We assume no responsibility for the content of websites
            linked on the Websites or Mobile Apps. Such links should not be
            interpreted as endorsement by us of those linked websites. We will
            not be liable for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of
            them.
